# REQUIRED FOR EVERY INTERACTION

1. Read .cursor/inventory.mdx at the start of each interaction
2. Before ending ANY response, if you've learned anything useful about project-specific architectural details that are NOT immediately obvious from reading the code, you MUST update .cursor/inventory.mdx with this information
3. When updating .cursor/inventory.mdx:
   - Only add new information not already documented
   - Place information in the appropriate section
   - If no appropriate section exists, create one
   - ONLY document project-specific architectural decisions, custom patterns, and non-obvious implementation details
